In vue we can create functions using the methods property. Methods is an object that contains the fucntion(s).
In methods we can define one or more functions that we can use in the vue file.

Never use arrow functions for methods. 

To access a data property within a method (methods property) use "this" keyword. To pass the data property as an argument, we don't need "this" keyword.
